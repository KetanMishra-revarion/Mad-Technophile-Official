  <p>The standard one will be a usuall one, but there will be a higher frequency iteration that will
    push the clock speed significantly higher. The Snapdragon 8+Gen1â€™s prime core runs at
    3.15GHz, we expect the high frequency option to offer atleast 3.4GHz - 3.6GHz</p>
    <br>
  <p>However, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 will be based on TSMC's 4nm manufacturing process and it
    will power the iQOO 11 and we can expect it to be in few more flagships very soon</p>
